While using [Jekyll][jekyll] seems like a very nifty way to set up your own site without much of a hassle, one might find it quite intimidating when trying to setup a "picture-perfect" blog or portfolio right away and in one go. Dependency hell breaks loose and some other quirks of Jekyll start to show rather quickly.
I advise you to take your time to build such a project - developing it slowly, taking time to explore possibilities and getting to know Jekyll (more than) well.
Trust me - in some places, it can be terrifyingly shallow.
But nonetheless - final product is nice and satisfying.
And look at that cute `markdown` in action.
